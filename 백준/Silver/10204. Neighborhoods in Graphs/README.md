### 문제 설명

<p>Gru and Lucy put together a graph of super-villains to see if they can see any interesting connections, in order to find who stole the Arctic Circle Laboratory. In this graph, there is a node (vertex) for every super-villain, and there is an edge (connection) between two nodes if they have ever concocted a sinister plot together. The figure below shows an example of such a graph over 10 villains (to simplify things for you, we will use made-up simple names for the super-villains, of the form v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ..., and so on).</p>

<p>Given such a graph and a super-villain, your goal is to count to the number of super-villains in that super-villain’s 2-hop neighborhood in the graph, i.e., all the nodes that are within a distance of 2 from the given node. (This is also called “friends of friends query” in a social graph setting.) For example, for v<sub>1</sub>, this includes: v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>5</sub>, and v<sub>4</sub> (so the answer would be 4), whereas for v<sub>5</sub>, the 2-hop neighborhood includes: v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>4</sub>, v<sub>6</sub>, v<sub>7</sub>, v<sub>8</sub>, v<sub>9</sub>, i.e., all the nodes in the graph (so the answer would be 8). Note that, we don’t count v<sub>5</sub> to be in its own 2-hop neighborhood.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line in the test data file contains the number of test cases (< 100). After that each line contains a test case. The first two numbers in each test case represent the number of supervillains in the graph, n (n < 100), and the number of edges in the graph, e (e < 1000). After that, the next 2e Strings describe the edges. The last String on each line contains the id of a supervillain, vx.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, you are to output the number of nodes in the 2-hop neighborhood of vx. The exact format is shown below in the examples.</p>
