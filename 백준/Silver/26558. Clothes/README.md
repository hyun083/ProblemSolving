### 문제 설명

<p>Billy’s mom recently washed his clothes. When his mom finishes washing his clothes, she folds them and stacks them in one large pile. It is then Billy’s responsibility to sort the clothes into three drawers for shirts, pants, and socks. When he places these items in the drawers he takes the top one off of the stack his mom gave to him and places it at the top of the stack in the respective drawer.</p>

<p>Each day Billy must wear a shirt, pants, and socks. He simply picks the top one off each stack in each drawer to wear for that day. Given the original stack of washed clothes, determine what Billy will wear up until he needs more clothes washed. Billy needs more clothes when he runs out of any necessary article of clothing for the day. Billy will only wear a piece of clothing once before it is declared dirty and needs washing. He does not ever wear dirty clothes.</p>
